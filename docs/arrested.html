<h1> You the Caught Culprit!  </h1>
  <p>The murderer was the baker. Why would the chemistry lab assistant or his ex girlfriend want him dead? After questioning, Morris revealed the details of what transpired.<br>The night of the murder: Boy Boy drunkenly enters the bakery, short on money as usual and begs for a pastry. The tired staff give in to his demands by offering a chicken pie .Morris is less than pleased. Morris’ niece was the girl Boy had an affair with. He cheated on Emily with none other than the baker’s niece. Morris stops midway through preparing jam pastries for the morning after and confronts Boy Boy outside. The two scuffle and Morris chases Boy to the scene of the murder. Morris stabs him and the chicken pie that he crafted with his own hands. Upon realisation of his actions, he runs to discard the weapon somewhere far away. Morris knows Crystal along with her schedule. Morris sneaks into the chemical storage area and steals the acid while she leaves the area unattended. He ditches his clothes in the pond and changes into a fresh pair of clothes. Morris completed his pastries and went home that night.<br>Good job, Detective! You never disappoint.
